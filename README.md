# 2DSOIL_Grape
Derived from MAIZSIM

A modified version of 2dsoil that will simulate water balances for a grape orchard
This has a simple crop model to simulate a static root distribution and constant LAI
The program still needs modifications for the distribution between mature and young roots
and actual ET. At the moment it uses a constant ET to test water uptake
There are also files to create grids and input files. These are still under development and will be described later
