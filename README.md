# 2DSOIL_Grape
Derived from MAIZSIM, written in FORTRAN. The C++ model was removed to be replaced by a simple one.

A modified version of 2dsoil that will simulate water balances for a grape orchard
This has a simple crop model to simulate a static root distribution and constant LAI
The program still needs modifications for the distribution between mature and young roots
and actual ET. At the moment it uses a constant ET to test water uptake
There are also files to create grids and input files. These are still under development and will be described later

The folder IOWA06 contains test input files. The source files are in "Soil Source"
